1. Information We Collect
Camera Data:
We request access to your camera to allow you to take pictures of buildings or historical landmarks. These images are sent to an AI service (powered by OpenAI) for analysis. After the image is processed, it is deleted from our servers.

Location Data:
We use your location to enhance the AI’s analysis by determining where you are when sending the image. Your location is used temporarily and not saved after the analysis is completed.

Account Information:
To create an account, we collect your email address and your name. This information is used to manage your account and allow you to access past data, including images and analyses.

Password:
Your password is stored securely in Firebase using bcrypt hashing to ensure it is protected.

2. How We Use Your Information
Camera and Location Data: We use your camera to take pictures of buildings or historical sites and your location to improve the AI analysis. These are used temporarily and are not stored after processing.

Third-Party Services: We use OpenAI for AI-powered analysis of the images and Firebase for storing your account data securely.

3. Data Retention

Images are deleted after they are processed by the AI.

Location data is only used temporarily and is not stored after the analysis.
